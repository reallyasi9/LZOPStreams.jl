    LZO1X1CompressorCodec(level::Int=5) <: TranscodingStreams.Codec

A struct that compresses data according to the 1X1 version of the LZO algorithm.

The LZO 1X1 algorithm is a Lempel-Ziv lossless compression algorithm defined by:
- A lookback dictionary implemented as a hash map with a maximum of size of `1<<12 = 4096` elements;
- A 4-byte history lookup window that scans the input with a skip distance that increases linearly with the number of misses;
- A maximum lookback distance of `0b11000000_00000000 - 1 = 49151` bytes;

The C implementation of LZO defined by liblzo2 requires that all compressable information be loaded in working memory at once, and is therefore not adaptable to streaming as required by TranscodingStreams. The C library version claims to use only a 4096-byte hash map as additional working memory, but it also requires that a continuous space in memory be available to hold the entire output of the compressed data, the length of which is not knowable _a priori_ but can be larger than the uncompressed data by a factor of roughly 256/255. This implementation needs to keep 98310 bytes of input history in memory in addition to the 4096-byte hash map, and also caches literal copies in an array that expands as necessary during compression.

Arguments:
 - `level::Int = 5`: The speed/compression tradeoff paramter, with larger numbers representing slower compression at a higher compresison ratio. On a technical level, every `pow(2, level)` history misses increases by 1 the number of bytes skipped when searching for the next history match. The default (5) is recommended by the original liblzo2 authors as a good balance between speed and compression.

The argument `v` need only implement `getindex(v, ::Integer)`. If the search runs out of bounds, a `BoundsError` will be thrown. If no matches are found, `(0,0)` will be returned.

The method updates `dict` in place with new information about locations of elements from `v`.

Indices `i` of `v` are examined one at a time until `skip_start_index - i + 1` is equal to a multiple of `pow(2, skip_trigger)`, after which every other index is examined (then every third, fourth, etc.).
